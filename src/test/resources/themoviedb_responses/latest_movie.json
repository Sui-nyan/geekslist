  "overview": "The title Finding Fellowship is a double entendre. Fellowship is the name of the lane that two of the film’s subjects, Kisha and Jason, grew up on. This documentary has been about actively unearthing and finding the history of the community in which they grew up and the street that they grew up on is a wonderful symbol of that community. But the film is also about the power of people coming together in a shared interest and how that can only be achieved when actively pursued. In a world where we are often told that we are irreconcilably divided, we still believe in finding fellowship, and it’s this story that gives us hope.",
